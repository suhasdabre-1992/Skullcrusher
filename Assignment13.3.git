Problem- prediction of the number of comments in the upcoming 24 hours on
those blogs, the train data was generated from different base times that may
temporally overlap. Therefore, if you simply split the train into disjoint partitions,
the underlying time intervals may overlap. Therefore, you should use the provided,
temporally disjoint train and test splits to ensure that the evaluation is fair.

a. Interpret the final model coefficients.
b. Plot the model result and compare it with assumptions of the model.
