Perform the below operations:
A. Visualize the correlation between all variable in a meaningful
way, clear representation of correlations. Find out top 3
reasons for having more crime in a city.
Ans:-
>install.packages(Corrplot)
>Library(corrPlot)
>My_data<- read.csv(choose file())
>Crime_cor <- Cor(My_data)
>Corrplot (Crime_cor, method= "number")
>findCorrelation(x, cutoff = 0.3, names = FALSE,
  exact = TRUE)

B. What is the difference between covariance and correlation,
take an example from this dataset and show the differences if
any?
Ans:- 
>Covariances are very important throughout finance, but they are not scale free and they can be difficult to directly interpret. 
Correlation is the standardized version of covariance that ranges in value from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 in magnitude
indicate a strong linear relationship between pairs of variables.
>Install.packages(caret)
>library(Caret)
>My_data<- read.csv(choose file())
>cov(My_data)
>cor(My_data)
