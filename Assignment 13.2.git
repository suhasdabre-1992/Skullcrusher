Problem- prediction of the number of comments in the upcoming 24 hours on
those blogs, the train data was generated from different base times that may
temporally overlap. Therefore, if you simply split the train into disjoint partitions,
the underlying time intervals may overlap. Therefore, the you should use the
provided, temporally disjoint train and test splits to ensure that the evaluation is
fair.

a. Create a linear regression model to predict the number of comments
in the next 24 hours (relative to base time).
b. Fine tune the model and represent important features Visualize the
dataset and make inferences from that.
c. Interpret the summary of the linear model.
d. Report the test accuracy vs. the training accuracy
