a. Find out top 5 attributes having highest correlation (select
only Numeric features).
Ans:-
> my_data<-read.csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/communities/communities.data')
library (Caret)
>findCorrelation(my_data, cutoff = 0.5, Names = TRUE,
  exact = TRUE)
  
b. Find out top 3 reasons for having more crime in a city.


c. Which all attributes have high correlation with crime rate?
only_no <- my_data[,-127]
str(my_data)

high_cor <- cor(only_no)

for (i in 1:nrow(high_cor)){
  correlations <-  which((high_cor[i,] > 0.85) & (high-cor[i,] != 1))
  if(length(correlations)> 0){
    print(colnames(my_data)[i])
    print(correlations)
  }
}
